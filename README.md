# Medication Compliance Tracking System

## Overview

The **Medication Compliance Tracking System** is a Java Spring Boot application designed to help healthcare providers and patients manage medication schedules and monitor compliance effectively. The system tracks medication intakes, calculates compliance rates, and generates analytics for better insights into patient adherence.

This project includes:
- **Medication and Intake Management:** Allows users to schedule, record, and track medication intake.
- **Compliance Analytics:** Calculates compliance rates based on recorded intakes.
- **Moving Averages:** Generates simple, exponential, and weighted moving averages for medication intake trends.
- **Skip Reason Tracking:** Logs reasons for skipped medication intakes.
- **Timezone Handling:** Supports intake records across different time zones.

## Features

### ‚úÖ Medication and Intake Tracking
- Add, update, and manage medications.
- Schedule medication intake times and days.
- Record intakes with statuses (`TAKEN`, `MISSED`, `SKIPPED`).

### üìä Compliance Analytics
- Calculate compliance rates for users.
- Generate reports on taken, missed, and skipped doses.
- Identify compliance patterns.

### üìà Moving Averages Analytics
- Calculate Simple Moving Average (SMA), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and Weighted Moving Average (WMA) for medication trends.

### üïí Timezone Support
- Handles intake timestamps accurately across different time zones.

### ‚ùå Skip Reasons
- Log reasons for skipped intakes.
- Authorized skipping reasons for better tracking and validation.

2. **Get Moving Averages (WMA)**
    - `GET /api/v1/analytics/moving-averages?userId=1&medicationId=1&type=WMA&days=7`
    - Description: Retrieves the Weighted Moving Average for medication intake counts.

3. **Get Moving Averages (EMA)**
    - `GET /api/v1/analytics/moving-averages?userId=1&medicationId=1&type=EMA&days=7`
    - Description: Retrieves the Exponential Moving Average for medication intake counts.

### Intake Endpoints
4. **Get Intakes by User**
    - `GET /api/v1/intakes/user/1`
